# Pandas-Challenge

# Inside Pandas-Challenge Folder, their is README, and PyCitySchools
# Inside PyCitySchools folder is PyCitySchools.ipynb which is the main script
# Even though I used Jupyter notebook to write my code, pushed it via terminal to Pandas-Challenge folder
    (its showing up as Visiual Studio Code text, however its has the .ipynb extention)
# I followed instructions and results look exceptional
# I used open AI such as CHATGPT and Expert Learning Assistant to help me write the code

# School_Summery
    # School name
    # School type
    # Total student budget
    # Average math score
    # Average reading score
    % Passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    % Passing reading ('')
    % Overall passing (the passing of students who passed math AND reading)
# Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    # Sorted schools by "% Overall Passing" in ascending order displaying to 5 rows (Schools)
    # Saved the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools"
# Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    # Sorted schools by "% Overall Passing"
    # Saved results in DataFrame called "bottom_school"
# Math Scores by Grade
    # Performed necessary calculations that created a DataFrame that list the average math scores for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
# Reading Scores by Grade
    # Performed necessary calculations that created a DataFrame that list the average reading scores for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
# Scores by School Spending
    # Created a table that breaks down school perfomance beased on average spending range (per student)
# Spending Summary
    # Average math score
    # Average reading score
    # % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    # % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    # % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
# Scores by School Summary
    # Use pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame
    # Created a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)
# Scores by School Type
    # Used the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step and created a new DataFrame called type_summary.
    # This new DataFrame shows school performance based on the "School Type".
